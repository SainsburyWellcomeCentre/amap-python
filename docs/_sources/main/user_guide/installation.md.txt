# Installation

**Tested on Ubuntu (16.04 & 18.04) and Windows 10.**

*N.B. results may vary very slightly between operating systems*

#### Set up conda environment and install dependencies
**Recommended, allthough not necessary**

Conda environments are used to isolate python versions and packages.

**Once conda environment is set up, everything must be carried out 
in this environment**

* Download miniconda installation file 
[here](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh)

* Run miniconda installation file, e.g.:
    
```    
bash ~/Downloads/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
* Create and activate new minimal conda environment

``` bash
conda create --name amap python=3.7
conda activate amap
```    

#### Install amap


``` bash
pip install amap

```    

**If you use a conda environment, remember to activate it
 (`conda activate amap`) before using amap.**

#### Download atlas (optional)
When amap runs, the appropriate reference atlas will be downloaded (if not previously done so). If you would 
like to download in advance to save time (or if you will not have an internet
connection) please use `amap_download`.

Currently, the only supported atlas is the Allen reference mouse 
brain, originally from [here](http://help.brain-map.org/display/mouseconnectivity/API#API-DownloadAtlas).
The atlas will download into `./amap/atlas`. 

In the future, other atlases will be available, and you will be able to choose
which is downloaded.

If you want to modify the am amap download, use:
* `--atlas-install-path` Supply a path to download the atlas elsewhere. This 
should also update the default `registration.conf` file so that the correct 
atlas is sourced. Alternatively, use this command to tell amap where an 
existing atlas is, to save it being downloaded twice. (Requires 20GB 
disk space)
* `--atlas download path` The path to download the atlas into. 
(Requires 1.2GB disk space). Defaults to `/tmp`.
